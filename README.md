# Secret santa app 🎅🏽
* [Deployed](https://gaspicastello.github.io/secretsanta/)
* This was my first one, I just came up with this idea and pushed myself towards develop it from scratch to a deployed app.

## How it works
Names are listed below the form as the user submit name and email of participants, can delete anytime clicking over the name, after that when the list is done with more than 3 people, the list mixs it up to select secretly a person for each other, the secret santa.
Everyone is a Secret Santa of another participant so this person receives an email telling to whom make a gift.

## Run in developing server:
### `npm install`
and
### `npm start`

## ⚡Technologies and libraries:
React, EmailJs
